Week5Meet - 10 pts
Turn in on BBL as soon as complete, but before end of day Friday
following the lecture.

We are changing it up this time!
Answer these questions as we progress through the meeting.

1.Please circle/highlight the nouns in the following program requirements:

The Great Lakes Shipping company ships pallets of goods from an origin to
a destination. Sometimes the pallets get loaded onto boats and shipped
across a lake, but many pallets get loaded onto trucks for some portion of
their trip. The company is making use of cutting-edge tech and has invested
in self-driving electric vans for last mile delivery. They need to be able
to track pallets, assign them to a boat or truck or van, load, and unload
pallets. Each boat has a captain, and each truck has a driver. In addition,
with fuel prices fluctuating, they need to track fuel on the boats and trucks.
All vehicles that use fuel, use diesel.

ANS:
Boats
Trucks
Vans
Pallets

2.Make a list with the most likely candidates for classes at the top of the list.
Who did you work with?
ANS:
Pallets, Boats, Truck, Van

3.The keyword this. Take a look at the toString() method in the Pallet class:

public String toString(){
     String label = "PalletID: " + this.getID() + "\nOrigin: " +
     this.getOrigin() + "\nDestination: " + this.getDestination() +
     "\nDim: " + this.getDimensions();
     return label;
   }
In your own words, why are we using the this keyword here?

ANS:
The keyword 'this' is referencing to the method of the current class



4.Read the Fuelable interface:
public interface Fuelable {
  public void addFuel(int fuel);
  public int getFuel();
}

Then read the implementations of each method in Boat and Truck:
public void addFuel(int fuel){
     fuelGallons += fuel;
}
public int getFuel(){
     return fuelGallons;
}
If the boat can hold 100 gallons of diesel, how can you improve the implementation
of addFuel() so it is impossible to add fuel over the 100 gallon limit?

ANS:
public void addFuel(int fuel){
     int Limit = 100;
     if(full <= 100){
        fuelGallons += fuel;
     }
}

If Truck has two fuel tanks of 50 gallons each(a not uncommon occurrence) how
could you improve the implementation code for addFuel() for the truck?
ANS:
public void addFuel(int fuel){
     if (fuel <= tank1){
       tank1 = fuelGallons + fuel;
     }else if (tank1 == 50 && (fuel - tank1) != 0){
       tank2 = fuelGallons + fuel;
     }else {
       System.out.println("Both tanks are filled");
     }
   }
Note: tank1 and tank2 are declared in the class Trunk.java

5.For the load and unload methods, is the pallet object changed in any way?
public boolean load(Pallet p){
     boolean fits;
     if ((capacity - p.getVolume()) > 0){
       fits = cargo.add(p);
       capacity -= p.getVolume();
     }
     else {
       fits = false;
     }
     return fits;
   }

   public Pallet unload(Pallet p){
     int loc = cargo.indexOf(p);
     int vol = p.getVolume();
     capacity += vol;
     return cargo.remove(loc);
   }

ANS:
The object was not changed, it was only used to get the values of variables
declared in Pallet


6.Develop your white-box test cases for your chosen class. Who did you work with?
I worked with Mangesh.

7.What is the name of your tester file? Submit the .java file
ANS:
Tester.Java

8.What are the results of your test cases? How do you KNOW you tested every line
of code in your class?
ANS:
By testing each and every methods given by each class


Reflect on your learning and your needs. After this class meeting, what topics do
you feel like you learned and what topics do you feel like you need more
information on to learn?
ANS:
Unit testing
Objects
Reference types
