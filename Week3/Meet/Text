Turn in on BBL as soon as complete, but before end of day Friday following the lecture.
===============================
Reading a program
Read both programs. Be the computer and trace which line of code is executing in order.
Keep track of what the current state of each variable is.

Everything below this line relates ONLY to the problem discussed in class, the code we
wrote together.
I understand the problem introduced in class to be: (in your own words)

My UML Diagram for these classes: (feel free to paste in a photo of a hand done diagram)

The solution to the problem were the following programs:
(provide the names of the .java files only)

I tested the solution with at least 3 different value sets. The test data and results are:
(use this format: var1 = data, var2 = data, etc -> result)

Reflect on your problem-solving:
How confident are you in the solution?
How often do you go to the Internet when working on your lab?
How often do you refer to programs from class or the text when working on your lab?

Reflect on your learning and your needs. After this class meeting, what topics do
you feel like you learned and what topics do you feel like you need more
information on to learn?
