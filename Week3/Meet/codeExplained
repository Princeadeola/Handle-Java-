Errors encountered in the code before corrections:
Error1: reverseString method not created -- replaced with reverse
Error2: Error 2:- mix variable is not initialized -- initialized it to empty string
Error3: NO condition to check if it looks like original word

Que: I understand the problem introduced in class to be:
Ans:
I understand the problem introduced in the class to be
a word scramble program that receives an input from the user,
then checks for the vowel sound in it (a e i o u),
it then returns the substring of the vowel,
it then concatenate the substring with the substring
starting from index 0 till the index of the vowel

Que: My UML Diagram for these classes:
Ans:
    Attached image to submission

Que:The solution to the problem were the following programs:
Ans:
PuzzlePage.java
WordScramble.java

Que:I tested the solution with at least 3 different value sets. The test data and results are:
Ans:
The condition is to only reverse if it still looks like the original word
var1 = kevin  (will return INKEV which does not look like original word 'kevin')
result: INKEV

var2 = on    (still looks like original word 'on')
result: NO

var3 = oom   (still looks like the original word 'oom')
result: MOO

Reflect on your problem-solving:
Que: How confident are you in the solution? :
Ans:
I am very confident

Que: How often do you go to the Internet when working on your lab?
Ans:
I visited the oracle docs to reflect on my understanding of
some of the methods like subString() and also working with recursive calls

Que: How often do you refer to programs from class or the text when working on your lab?
Ans:
Quite often to understand to reference instructions and code sample

Que: Reflect on your learning and your needs. After this class meeting, what topics do
you feel like you learned and what topics do you feel like you need more
information on to learn?
Ans:
With this lesson, I am able to not just understand but utilize some of the methods,
also I am able to take out time of read the conditional statements which I will do more
study on with more examples and references
