Week3Lab – 10 pts
Pre-lab questions
Conditional statements can take some practice. Work each of these out to see
what they evaluate to. You may find it useful to create truth tables in your notes (p. 195)

1.String apple = “Rome”;
String city = “Rome”;
String fruit = “apple”;
double cost = 5.25;
double value = 3.0;
int count = 10;
int qty =80;
Boolean old = false;
Boolean smart = true;


a.apple == fruit
b.city.equals(apple)
c.cost > value
d.apple != city
e.!old ||smart
f.smart && (value <= cost/2.0)
g.(value == cost) && (count < 10)
h.(qty < value) || (qty < cost)
i.!(qty < value) && (value < cost)

2.If statements in Java are related to if sentences in English. Convert each of these
sentences into their Java equivalent. Remember to declare any variables needed:

a.If there are more than 10 cookies on the tray, I will take one.

b.If the cookie tray has Oreo’s and there are more than 10 cookies on the tray,
I will take an Oreo.

c.If the top is on sale for less than $25 or more than 50% discount and I have at least
twice the cost of the top in my wallet, I will buy it.

d.I will go swimming is the weather is sunny and the temperature is over 85.

e.Help me set my alarm clock. I get up at 8 am most days, but on Thursday I have to get up
at 7 am and on Saturday and Sunday I get to sleep until 9 am.








Choose one of the following do develop into a program that uses at least one class outside
of the class that contains the main method. Once chosen, do the following:
Understand the problem (restate in your own words, make any assumptions clear):

UML diagrams of any classes needed, including the one with main:

Pseudocode of each class:

Name of files (.java) submitted:


Smart Mailbox
With the availability of cheap sensors and processors, you have an idea to improve the
common roadside mailbox. Develop and write an object oriented program that represents the
mailbox. Think about the things a smart mailbox would know about itself (the state) and
what a smart mailbox should be able to do (the behaviors).
Also think about how the homeowner/renter would interact with the smart mailbox. Write a
sample driver program (with a main method) that uses the mailbox class you created.

Binary / Decimal Quiz Generator
Someone important to you needs to practice their binary to decimal conversions and decimal
to binary conversions. You decide to practice your object oriented programming skills to
solve this problem. Develop and write a program that will generate a problem of each type
with randomness. Each time you ask for a quiz, it creates two questions, each based on a
random decimal number.

You will also need to create the class with a main method that will print out the problems.
Don’t worry about the answer key, just generate the problems.

Tracking EBooks
You’ve recently gotten into reading ebooks and now have several apps and formats, some are
rented and some are yours, some are on your phone and some are in the cloud, etc. You need
to get a handle on this AND you want one easy way to see what you have, what you’ve read and
what you want.  Design an ebook class with all the information you think an ebook should know
about itself (format, title, author, etc) in addition to the information you WANT it to know
(whether you’ve read it, own it, want it, etc.). Then design its behaviors, which should be
related to those variables as you will want to set or change some of them such as marking a
book read once you finish it.

You will then create the class with main that you will use to create several ebook objects,
setting their variables and using their methods. Don’t forget to write a toString method so
you can print an ebook out in a way that makes sense.
