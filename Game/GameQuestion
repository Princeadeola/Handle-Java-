Choosing a Game for Family Game Night - a little program

You own several games and you decide to write a program to make it easier
to fairly choose a game to play on family game night. This will be your first
pass at this program. The user will enter information for each game for as many
games as they want. The name of the game and at least two additional attributes
will be included. After all the games have been entered, the user will see the full
list of games print to the screen. The program will randomly select one and display
it with a message "May we recommend ...". The program will make use of at least one of
the additional attributes in a way that uses an if statement and displays or processes
a subset of the list of games.

Technical requirements:

At least 2 files
At least 2 Constructors

A toString() method in the class for the games

A loop with a sentinal for data entry

Use of ArrayList

Use of Random to choose a game

Loop with an if to process games

Planning: Includes any classes you choose to create with all attributes and
behaviors defined. Includes pseudocode for the major methods and for the driver
program (the one with a main method).
ANS:
<=======pseudocode for the Game class=====>
=> Greeting to the user
=> Ask the use for game to play
=> User select an option
=> Checks for the game that the users options matches
=> Calls the object of the game
=> Calls the method to run the game
=> If the user enters anything not among the option then it brings a warning
=> Else it opens the game to play

NOTE: The games are implemented from ideas seen on stackoverflow

General advice: I do not expect everyone to get this written in an IDE, tested
and debugged in the time you have. For that reason, you can turn in txt files OR
.java files. They have to be in a zip folder with your drexel abc123 id and Midterm.
Mine would be named "trp74_Midterm.zip". Do each part, in order, if you want a chance
at partial credit. Upload the zip file to this question.
