Week2Meet - 10 pts
Turn in on BBL as soon as complete, but before end of day
Friday following the lecture.
===============================
Reading a program
Write pseudocode for the GenerateCode program.

I understand the problem introduced in class to be: (in your own words)
The program introduce in class is to generate set of random code in a particular pattern
My plan to solve this problem is:
Ask user to input answers to some set of questions
Generate a random number between 2 to 8

Use the string method replace vowel sounds (a,e,I,o,u) with empty eg.
String shortFvrt = favorite.replace('a', ' ');

Print result in a define way to reflect motive eg.
System.out.printf("Code #1: %s%d%s\n", lovedOne, year, shortFvrt);
S means string and the d means decimal



The solution to the problem was the following program:
(provide the name of the .java file only)
GenerateCode.java
I tested the solution with at least 3 different value sets. The test data and results are:
(use this format: var1 = data, var2 = data, etc -> result)
Var 1,
 lovedOne = tomi;
favourite = eba,
place = Ikire,
year =2003,
Output
Code #1: tomi2003b
Code #2: b4ikire
Code #3: tomi4ikire2003
Code #4: 4ikire2003tomi

Var 2
lovedOne = lekan;
favourite = rice,
place = Ibadan,
year =2010,
Output
Code #1: lekan2010rc
Code #2: rc7ibadan
Code #3: lekan7ibadan2010
Code #4: 7ibadan2010lekan

Var 3
lovedOne = tinuke;
favourite = poundedyam,
place = regina,
year =2021,
Output
Code #1: tinuke2021pnddym
Code #2: pnddym2regina
Code #3: tinuke2regina2021
Code #4: 2regina2021tinuke




Reflect on your problem-solving:
How confident are you in the solution?  I very confident, I believe
there is room for learning more
On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 not at all confident and 10 very confident,
how confident are you in reading the programs provided in lecture?
10
How confident are you in writing the programs in lecture? 9
How confident are you in writing the labs on your own? 9

Reflect on your learning and your needs. After this class meeting, what
topics do you feel like you learned and what topics do you feel like you need
more information on to learn?

I learned how to manipulate string using string methods
str.Replace();
str.substring();
str.toLowerCase();
str.toUpperCase();
I also learned how to use the random
Random randGen = new Random();
