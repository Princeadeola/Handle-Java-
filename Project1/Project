Laundry cost
As an international graduate student who like to budget for all expenses. I like to know the
amount I spend on laundry biweekly, monthly and quarterly, we have two machines with one for
wash and the other for drying. For every wash it cost 8quarters ($2) and for every dry it cost
another 8quarters ($2). It is assumed that every user needs to use the laundry at least once a
week and at least one set of wash.
I would like to have a tool that allows me to enter sets of wash I have on average weekly, and it
would be able to output the cost for the week, month and Quarter.
The inputs would be the set number.
The output would be the cost incurred at the laundry.
